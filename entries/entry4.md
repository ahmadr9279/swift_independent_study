# Entry 4: The Teeny-tiny bit of Pomodoro Timer
Feels so good to be done with Swift Tutorial since previous entry. However, there's still a lot to learn!  I have been looking up Cocoa Pods a little, exploring to-do list app for a while, and making a basic countdown timer. 

## Updates on Cocoa pods 
This week, I was trying to find a useful pod from cocoa pods to use, but I couldn't find it after watching some youtube videos. My biggest issue for Cocoa Pods is knowing where to find all the available pods. All I know is the pod Alamofire, which is used for APIs. While I have a feeling that I will use Alamofire in the future, I don't think I would need to use an API for my productivity app so far.

## Built a to-do list?
I skimmed through multiple tutorials on creating a to-do list, but it is mainly for the older versions of Swift, but I decided to give it a try, and upon so many errors and confusion for terms that are being described in the tutorial, I had to clone the project and see how it works. While I do understand why the Youtuber, Riley Norris, uses the codes he uses, but I don't know how he knows what to use. I did add some comments on the code I cloned to make sure I understand some parts of it, and I also circled some terms I do not know.
Here is a screenshot of what I'm talking about:

</p>  

To sum up, I did get a basic gist of how to-do-list works, and after I understand how the codes work, I will make my own to-do list in the future. 

## Pomodoro Timer
I wanted to create a Pomodoro timer but my ability won't let me right now. I figure I would need to know how to know to create a basic timer first before jumping into the advanced timers.  
Here's my Plan:
1. Code along on how to make a basic timer. 
2. Make sure I have a full understanding of how the storyboard interacts with the viewController (Especially, knowing how user's input can be recognized by the  viewController)  
3. Draft pseudocodes and break down the different components of a Pomodoro Timer
4. Start Coding  

I finished the tutorial, but I realized that Swift is not just about coding. For Ruby, most of what is displayed is being coded. For instance, if you want to build a text box, you would have to code it. Unlike Ruby, Swift is more hands. I have to know how to use toolbox (text is one of them), what tools exist, and how to connect the available tools to the view controller. 

Two types of connection: 
1. **Outlet** is basically the appearance or properties of the object in the storyboard.

</p>  

2. **Action** is when you want the object you selected to perform a certain action and this involves using codes.

## A basic timer  
I coded along with a youtube video called, "Countdown Timer Tutorial in Swift/Xcode", but added my own properties and commented my code to make sure I understand.

## Progress since Entry 1
- [x] Have an idea of what to create + Have an outline
- [x] Get to know Xcode (how to navigate, built app, and use playgrounds)
- [x] Set up apple stimulator with Xcode and apply functions to the app (i.e button click)
- [x] Finish Swift Tutorial
- [ ] connect Swift with MySQL _I decided that it is better to do that with Jennifer, who is working on MySQL, in class time_
- [ ] Research useful cocoa pods for my productivity app _I did researched, but I will have to come back to it_
- [x] Apply things I learn from the tutorial to my app 
- [ ] Built a to-do list (tutorial already exist) _didn't built my own yet, and is still trying to learn how by looking at existing codes_
- [x] Learn how to build a basic timer 
- [ ] Plan & Built a Pomodoro Timer  

## Takeaway
1. **Have a good foundation before creating something big**. I jumped right into creating a to-do list while coding along with a youtube video until I realize that I do not understand many terms that were mentioned, and why I was doing itï¼Œso I ended up cloning the project and trying to break down the codes (and the learning continues). 

2. **Explore what already exist**. I really wanted to create a Pomodoro timer, but I can not start making one immediately. Since there are no existing projects of a Pomodoro Timer (from what I have found), I know that I will run into errors that I will most likely not have a solution for. Knowing that I am a Swift beginner, I started making a basic timer first, which there are so many resources and examples that exist, and hopefully built up to a Pomodoro timer.
