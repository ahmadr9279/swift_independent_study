# Entry 1: Productivity App Intro/Plan 

## Figuring out what to do  
What am I going to do for 9 weeks completely on myself? What computer language should I learn? Frustration came to me as an immediate response. With complete autonomy, starting is always the hardest. Here are some of the programming languages that came to my mind as I reflected, searched, and watched some youtube videos.  

1. **Javascript** (web-based) and **Python** (mainly used for data analysis) showed up on almost all the youtube videos as the most popular languages to know for the job market.  
2. In terms of apps, **Java** is for Android apps and **Swift** is for IOS apps.  
3. On my first day of the intern, one of the managers asked me if I was familiar with **PHP + MySQL**. It turns out that this is the language most start-up companies started up with.  

I still don’t know which language I should learn so I took a different route. I know that I always wanted to create some sort of productivity app, so I opened up a google doc and started planning.

_Because this is huge project, Jennifer and I decided to cross out some of ideas for now, so we can get our Minimum Viable Product done._

**Final Decision**: Because both Jennifer and I both wanted to create a productivity app, we decided to cooperate. Jennifer will be learning MySQL, and I will be learning Swift.

## What is Swift?   
Swift is a programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.  

#### :wavy_dash: Setting up Swift  
By googling “Swift set up,” I came across the Download section on [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/).  

Scrolling down to the Installation section, I was able to followed step by step on the instructions and downloaded all the necessary files (Xcode, Ubuntu…) for swift 5.0.
- The downloading process took me more than an hour. After downloading, I had to set up the toolkit for Xcode to make sure all components of Xcode is set up.

_**Xcode** is where I will be using swift._

## Welcome to Xcode
Opening up Xcode, three options appeared. I can get started with a playground, create a new Xcode project, or clone an existing Xcode project. Because I don’t have an existing project on Xcode, I decided to tinker around with the first two option.  

#### :star: Get Started with a Playground  
I opened up a **playground**, a place where I can tinker and experiment around with Swift programming. Then I looked up at Youtube for Swift tutorial and watched 10 minutes of a 3 hour+ long video just to get a gist of the playground.  

_I will definitely get back to the video once I am comfortable working with Xcode._

- Right side of the diagram: preview of what the code does  (reminds me of "return" on Ruby when you display it on REPL)  
- Bottom of the diagram: where the code is executed reminds me of the “puts” on ruby.  
- Learned about var (for declaring a new variable). Just like all the programming language I learned, a variable holds some data
- Printed "Hello, playground!"

#### :star: Create a new Xcode projectM  
I watched another Youtube video on how to create a Xcode project, and the video recommended me to check out the _Starter’s Guide Make Your First App with Xcode_ (a free book). This is where I began reading a 114-page book on how to make my first app. Most of the reading is helping me understand how to use Xcode and explaining the different icons or functions I see.

## Takeaways  
1. **Plan before you actually start.** It is always helpful to think about what you want to create first and then decide what tools you would need to create. 
2.  **Look up for resources.** I had to watch multiple videos and even read a book in the end to get started with the very basics of understanding Xcode and Swift.  
3. **Learn Actively.** Reading a 114 page book will be boring. Luckily, there are visualizations and clear directions, so I opened Xcode and try the steps while following along. Trying out things helps me learn the best.
